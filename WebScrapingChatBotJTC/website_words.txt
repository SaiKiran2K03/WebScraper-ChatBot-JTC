JTG’s mission is to help companies scale up their businesses and create real life impact by solving the toughest technical / business problems through technology. We strive to achieve long term success by creating value for not only our stakeholders but more importantly for the people across the globe.

Holding Majors in Electronics from the prestigious NSIT, Rishu got through various Ivy League MBA Schools but decided instead to take his first step towards his childhood dream to become an entrepreneur.

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      Cricketing Fever in JTG: A Team Wellness Initiative April 18, 2019   CricketFever Fun@Work JTGCricket LoveForSports WellnessProgram  Being a cricket-crazy nation, it comes as no surprise that the team wellness initiative taken up by JTG’s organizing committee would involve a cricket match. A young organization teeming with sporty millennials, JTG’s fun loving bunch never lose an opportunity to indulge in some refreshing outdoor activity. And so our endeavour to steer our team members towards a healthier lifestyle started with a much anticipated cricket match! The match was held on the 12th of April, at the Croire Cricket Club after office hours. When it comes to cricket, there’s no need to coax people to participate. With loads of sign ups, the team were eventually decided and the cricket match kicked off with great excitement and gusto. Here’s what you need to know about the racy match between Night Watchers and Game Swingers : The action-packed match kicked off with Night Watchers winning the toss and deciding to field. Digvijay and Amal were the opening batsmen. They played really well and created a 37 run partnership for the first wicket in 5 overs. After the fall of Digvijay’s wicket, their team started losing wickets fast and were 53/5 in 9 overs. After that, It was Rohit and Shubham who contributed 19 and 18 runs respectively to take their team to a grand total of 132 runs in 20 overs. Honourable contributions from Game Swingers were 25 by Digvijay, 19 by Rohit and 18 by Shubham From Night Watchers, Pankaj made a mark by taking 2 wickets. Also, Gaurav, Nikhil, Deepak, Kapil and Saksham took 1 wicket each. On the other hand, Night Watchers lost 3 wickets on 17 runs in 4 overs. Then came the match-winning 45 run partnership between Nikhil Kaplas and Shivam Singh, making their team’s total 62 in 9 overs. After the fall of Shivam’s wicket, Nikhil also made 40 runs in partnership with Akhilesh, taking their team to 102 in 13 overs. After that, it was only the point of scoring winning runs, which Deepak did by hitting a 4 on 2nd delivery of 18th over, making their team’s final score to be 136 runs on 6 wickets. Honourable contributions from Night Watchers were 51 by Nikhil Kaplas, 24 by Shivam and 19 by Pankaj. From Game Swingers, Digvijay took 2 wickets. Also, Rohit, Shubham and Jasmeet took 1 wicket each. The match went on for 3 hours with each team giving a commendable performance. JTG’s cricketing heroes for 2019 (decided by the 2 captains): Man of the Match – Nikhil Kaplas for his amazing 51 runs and 1 wicket Best Fielder – Shivam Singh for his 2 spectacular catches Final scores- While Game Swingers team scored 132 runs in 20 overs, Night Watchers was declared the winner of the match with 136 runs scored in 18 overs! An employee engagement initiative by JTG, the cricket match was a resounding success and turned out to be a sporty evening of fun, entertainment, healthy competition and a perfect start to the weekend!

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact     Insane Holi Experience in JTG! March 26, 2019   Colours FestivalofColours Holi HoliCelebration IndianFestival MastiUnlimited  On a day when the world is a whirl of colours, team members at Josh Technology Group got into the Holi mood a day in advance (because we take fun as seriously as work!) So how did our Holi celebrations look? Wild. Wet. And Crazy!!! Beware! Our coders and non coders are all party animals! And wouldn’t it have been totally criminal to miss out on an opportunity to let down our hair and have some colourful and no-holds-barred fun? We celebrated the triumph of good over evil (that’s what Holi’s about) a tad unconventionally. After a day of routine work, Holi eve kickstarted with people making their way to our large and airy terrace, where long tables of goodies awaited, complete with Holi must-haves like gujiya, namkeens, pani puri and the works! Our sober and staid office space began to show telltale signs of the pandemonium which was about to follow with colours strewn all over the floor and furniture. As the loudspeakers began to belt out the most iconic Bollywood Holi chartbusters, it was finally time to unplug our laptops. As the day drew to a close, celebrations got wilder and wetter with people getting hosed down with coloured water and some hapless souls being plunged into tubs of water! While the drummers kept the tempo soaring high, JTG team members continued to chug down thandai and get high on music, wild dancing, and yes COLOURS!!! Within moments (or so it seemed), tray upon tray full of heaped colours were strewn all over the place and pretty much everyone around was unrecognizable- we were all splattered from head to toe in colours. It’s was a free-for-all madness! Work culture at JTG: And that’s how we sum up the spirit of the JTG family. Whatever we do, we invest our 100% into it, heart and soul! We work together, grow together, and have kickass fun together! And that’s how things work in Josh- no boring office vibe to be found here. If you like working AND partying in equal measures, then you’re home baby!

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      JTG Hackathon April 2019: The Highlights April 26, 2019   CodersFaceOff CodingCompetition Hackathon PassionforCodes WarOfCodes  For JTG coders, coding isn’t just work; it’s a way of life. We love what we do and what’s more? We embrace our passion to make significant contributions to our field of work- technology! Hackathon is no mere coding competition. It’s a 3-day carnival with tons of fun, late nights, great food, all night gaming and YES- our best coders butting heads to come up with the most daredevil ideas and products! How did the 3-Day Hackathon unfold? The first day of Hackathon started with an opening discussion where every team presented the final idea that they would be working on (there had been multiple meetings and brainstorming sessions leading to this meeting). Hackathon t-shirts and sippers were distributed among the teams and the organizing committee, pictures clicked, and the event kicked off with much good cheer and gamesmanship. The teams all worked in the same room with two days and two nights of conceptualizing, coding, experimenting, and comparing notes to come up with tangible dummies for their ideas. Snacks and drinks were on the house with goodies heaped on a table to keep the morale high (creativity runs dry on an empty stomach, don’t you think?) With pulsating music playing from speakers, the vibe was a festive one. The extended weekend was an action-packed one, and JTG coders ALWAYS rise to the occasion when it comes to partying till the sun comes up! While the days saw bustling activity and tons of work getting done, the evenings and nights were one long party. The overnight stay on the office premises meant all-night gaming, great music, beer on the house, a never-ending supply of snacks, sumptuous buffet dinner, board games galore, table tennis, foosball, and more! The final day (Sunday) started rather slow with the contenders sleeping off their exhaustion and refueling with a piping hot breakfast of poha, sandwiches and coffee. There was a flurry of activity with the teams preparing for the final demonstration of their finished products. The presentations by the teams kicked off late morning with a variety of snacks and nibbles doing the rounds. Each presentation was followed by a question and answer round where the teams were grilled on their methodologies and ideas. While there was a lot of competitiveness in the air, the feeling of camaraderie was also running high. A final voting round resulted in the Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt winning the first prize. The April Hackathon ended with a nice hot lunch and lots of goofy selfies! The 3rd Hackathon Solving coding challenges, puzzles, and brainstorming for the best ideas is a great way to hone skills and taking coding to the next level. After 2 successful Hackathons, Josh coders rose to the occasion yet again with 8 teams coming up with the most clutter-breaking ideas focused on solving pain points across different areas of life. Here are the 8 projects undertaken by our coders for this year’s coding battle: Project 1 – Email Manager The whole idea behind this project was to automate processes that are currently being done manually by the HR, thereby creating a smoother process of sending out emails without lapses. This included several tasks like automatic emails for birthdays, work-anniversaries, festivals, monthly birthday celebrations manager, automatic emails to the new joiners, etc. Project 2 – Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt Team 2 came up with a Treasure Hunt application which uses augmented reality to provide clues that can only be seen through the app. The user will be getting clues as textual and visual content augmented in the real world, like for example when viewing a particular object or being in a particular spot. Project 3 – Mattermost Plugin – Google Assistant/Alexa Team 3 came up with a concept that used mattermost plugin for integrating voice actions through google assistant or Alexa. Features include voice action to update user’s status in mattermost and voice action to get user’s total unread messages count. Project 4 – MM-2-Email Team 4 also came up with an idea where mattermost plugin was used to send all mattermost posts and replies of particular channel to an email thread. Features include sending an email whenever something is posted in mattermost channel and sending replies of Mattermost on the same email thread. Project 5 – Augmented Reality Notifications Team 5 came up with an android application that allows the user to see mobile phone notifications on their hand using Augmented Reality. More options can be viewed using different hand gestures. During the demonstration the team used a phone’s camera for showing the AR objects but this should be done using devices like Google Lens. Project 6 – Tuckshop Automation An android application that reduces the manual effort the goes into maintaining the office’s tuckshop records. An app created on the lines of a shopping app that allows users to choose and buy products available in the tuck shop. The user can also see his outstanding amount and purchase history on the app. Project 7 – Chatbot An application that can help in the field of recruitment and automate the process of answering candidate queries through the use of chatbots. Data can be fetched from the existing database as per the requirement / intent of the question framed by the candidate. Project 8 – Exoogle Search The project involved a chrome plugin which would interact with custom google search engine to improve search relevance for technology-related topics. Exoogle involves a complete system that interacts with the search engine and takes recommendations from users and peers to bring up more relevant results for searches.

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      JTG welcomes a fresh team of techies, grows team in 2020 January 9, 2020   2020 began on a propitious note for JTG with a new batch of promising joiners, fresh out of college, being warmly welcomed into the Josh family. Currently building and expanding teams to achieve newer milestones and to continue on the path of IT excellence, JTG has been getting fresh talent onboard. And so on the 6th of Jan, our new batch of developers officially started their careers with us and we couldn’t be more excited! Here’s how the joining day panned out: Breakfast on the house: Our whole idea of induction revolves around helping freshers feel more at home and settle in well. And what could be a better way to get comfy than with a nice hearty breakfast with fellow newbies? And so the new team started the first day of their corporate journey with a cheerful meal peppered with informal introductions and light-hearted banter. Ice-Breaker Activity: After a brief check-in with the HR (where they were given a walkthrough of the policies and processes), the most action-packed (and irreverent) part of the induction began. An icebreaker with-a-twist unfolded, where the new team members had to visit the various teams in the office and get answers to questions given to them. In return, they would enjoy playful interactions with their seniors, complete with gifts of chocolates and selfies. As the ice-breaker game really took off, the excitement caught on and folks in every room had a whale of a time getting to know the new kids on the block. The high-on-life college vibe of the Josh office space comes from the fact that most of our team members are under 30 and love to have a good time! And that’s exactly what we did. We had a blast and showed the newcomers a good time too. JTG University: A presentation followed, where the new joiners were introduced to JTG’s rigorous 8-week bootcamp, inspired by the award-winning study by Harvard Business School Professors, Thomas J. DeLong and Michael Paley. Each joiner was introduced to 3 ‘guiding buddies’ to support them during the bootcamp and 9 mentors to guide them through the next 8 weeks of intense training (a different mentor for every week). The JTG University curtain-raiser was followed by an informal introduction to the mentors. All the mentors have been a part of the organisation for more than half a decade and have been handpicked from within the organisation because of their proven expertise and impressive body of work. Each mentor’s introduction included his years of experience, hobbies, the list of tech stacks he has worked on and 1 quirky fact about him. The idea behind JTG University is not just to make our techies industry-ready, but to hone their skills to a level where they are ahead of the game and prepared enough to take on any challenges and pressures head on. And that is why JTG University is perfect for freshers as they’re high on energy, passion and dedication required to complete such an intense course with flying colours. Ritual cake-cutting and cake-smashing: There was a more traditional welcome ritual in the evening, where the entire organisation gathered for a ritual cake-cutting in honour of the new entrants. The cake cutting was followed by the JTG ritual of cake-smashing, where folks have chunks of cake slathered on their faces as a part of the initiation. And then finally, you’re one of us! A word about the work culture of Josh Technology Group: At JTG, our team is our biggest asset and an integral part of our growth story. And we take pride in going the extra mile to make our new team members feel welcome. Being a young organisation, the induction and initiation of freshers is light-hearted, exciting and evokes much hilarity and gaiety. And that’s pretty much how a routine day at the JTG office shapes up- lots of hustle & bustle, socialising and fun events, with a no-compromise policy when it comes to getting work done. Our message to our new team members And so a heartfelt welcome to our new colleagues and pals. Prepare for one heck of a roller coaster ride, because at Josh, we believe that every moment at work should inspire the best in us and keep things forever astir and buzzing!

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact     6 Ways How AI is Impacting (Or Is Set To) Impact Everyday Life September 3, 2019   In the last few years, the concept of Artificial Intelligence has taken over practically every aspect of our lives. From Mark Zuckerburg to Elon Musk, everyone has been hotly debating and talking about AI and its global impact. AI has been affecting our lives in more and more tangible ways and in ways we could never have imagined. The idea that computers are ‘intelligent’ had been established as far back as the 1950s when computer pioneer Alan Turing asked whether machines can think. 70 years down the line, AI has evolved from a vague concept to a ubiquitous reality, impacting and shaping the very fabric of our lives. And the right combination of factors like the internet and internet-connected devices that generate an overwhelming quantity of data and cloud computing and software algorithms are recognizing patterns within data and taking the game to the next level. Here are some interesting ways in which AI will impact the common man (or already has): Access to virtual multiple assistants – With technology embedded in gadgets and pieces of furniture across the house, we’ll have voice-based technologies in cars, TVs, lamps and more. We already have Alexa doing our bidding. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The practical new result could be more confusing than helpful. Very soon we could all have multiple virtual assistants guiding, helping and supporting us in our daily routines. Toothbrush with AI abilities – Oral B recently unveiled their AI powered toothbrush that could guide you on your dental hygiene and tell you whether you’re brushing your teeth for the right amount of time and at the right places. News and market reports tailored for you – Now this is a function  that we’re all already experiencing (and loving).  News you’re interested in and topics you’d like to read about are handed to you on a platter. Based on the data generated by your previous searches, the internet can provide you with content that you would specifically enjoy. AI can also help generate very in-depth reports on how your portfolio of stocks is performing on the market. And no, we’re not talking about the reports that do a general recap of market response. These reports give you a more detailed idea about EXACTLY where you stand with an analytical statement like “At 1pm, the market went up by 1% but your stock value dropped by 2%. The purchase of xy stock is partially responsible as it has sharply fallen since last week….” Your gadget could become your buddy – Folks who have watched the award-winning sci-fi romantic drama ‘Her’ will definitely catch the drift. Your operating system could become your mentor and confidante in the near future. Going beyond the routine questions and answers, machines are now well on their way to having meaningful conversations with you. Your devices are getting a whole lot smarter by studying data and learning how humans behave and respond to different situations. Detailed answers, personal queries and insightful suggestions will be provided by devices based on what we’re doing (or trying to do). Automated transportation – Airplanes use FMS (Flight Management System), a combination of GPS, motion sensors, and computer systems to track their positions during flight. So the pilot of an an average Boeing 777 spends only a few minutes flying the plane, most during take off and landing. Self-driven cars are of course a more complex phenomenon due to more traffic on the roads, more obstacles and traffic rules. In spite of this, self-driven cars have proved to be safer than their  human-driven counterparts, according to a study with 55 Google vehicles that drove over 1.3 million miles altogether. Cyborg technology – According to Oxford C.S. professor Shimon Whiteson, technology will help us enhance many of our natural abilities in the near future. The human brain and limbs have their weaknesses but scientists foresee a future where AI can help the average human acquire the efficiency and unparalleled abilities of machines. AI can also help amputees regain the complete working of their limbs by enabling the brain to communicate with the robotic limb. AI is constantly evolving and Machine Learning is the newest approach where instead of encoding machines with information, machines are being enabled to learn how to learn.

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      JTG Wellness Initiative- Dental and Eye Check-Up Camps January 4, 2019   BecauseWeCare DentalCheckup EmployeeWellnessProgram EyeCheckUp Health HealthAboveAllElse  The health and overall wellness of our team members is our foremost priority and JTG is constantly endeavouring to put in place new measures to ensure that our team members stay at the top of their game. Right from arranging different sporting events like cricket, football, and table tennis matches, to conducting dental and eye check-up camps, we strive to help our team members make smart and healthy choices that can reduce health care costs, increase vitality and diminish absenteeism. Dental Camp by the Dentedge Team Ever heard of the saying ‘Every tooth in a man’s head is more valuable than a diamond’? Well wouldn’t we all agree on that one? And so our dedicated organizing committee held a 2-day dental camp this April by Dentedge within the office premises to provide our staff with free dental check ups and dental services at a discounted rate. Dentedge provides holistic dental solutions at affordable rates and right at your doorstep. With the latest dental equipment and a team of highly skilled dentists as a part of the team, JTG’s employee wellness team felt that a partnership with Dentedge could be a perfect way to create oral awareness among it’s team members. The check ups were conducted by a skilled team of doctors with insta oral cameras. Additional services like cleaning, bleaching, polishing, and laser-filling were provided at almost 50% discount. The camp helped in creating general awareness about dental problems, their treatments and effective methods of prevention. Specially designed to provide a relevant and affordable approach to oral hygiene, dental check-ups, and complete dental care needs, the Dentedge dental camp was a success as many of our team members underwent treatment and got professional medical advice at a highly subsidized rate. Lenskart Eye Check-Up Camp We believe that it is our privilege at JTG to watch out for the health and wellbeing of our family members and an important part of preventative healthcare is getting your eyes checked from time to time. Like dental health, Indians only seek medical help once the condition cannot be ignored. Keeping this predicament in mind, we arranged a free eye check-up camp to ensure that our team members don’t neglect one of the most important aspects of their health. After all, prevention is always better than cure, right? A team of medical experts from Lenskart set up camp in our office with eye testing equipment and throughout the day, conducted check ups for our employees. Discount vouchers were handed out and medical advice given to people who underwent the check ups. A routine eye examination can reveal much more than if vision is adequate. Many ocular conditions can be uncovered during an eye check up- conditions where the symptoms are manifest at a much later stage. One of the leading optical retailers in the country, Lenskart boasts more than 5 million plus app downloads, 410 stores and 200 home opticians. The team at Lenskart also answered every query that was raised during the camp about eye care.

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      2019 JTG Offsite to Jim Corbett National Park April 3, 2019   Fun@Work FunUnlimited JimCorbettPark JTGCulture JTGOffsite Offsite2019  A visit to India’s famous Jim Corbett National Park on Josh Technology Group’s 2019 offsite was everything it was expected to be and then some!!! The 3-day and 2-night trip to one of the country’s most spectacular locations kickstarted with a late night journey in 2 buses packed with almost 70 high-spirited team members. The oldest established national park and animal sanctuary in India, the pristine and lush landscape of Jim Corbett is the perfect place to unwind, relax and reconnect with nature. And that’s where the Josh Technology Group bandwagon was headed- for an extended weekend of non-stop recreation! The journey to Jim Corbett was just as eventful as the stay as the party started the minute the buses set off. There was an ice-breaking session with the freshers on the bus(employees less than a year-old in the organisation) along with the usual bonhomie and revelry. An early morning breakfast of piping hot parathas with tea at a roadside dhaba was followed by the last leg of the journey. Day 1: The JTG team reached the Golden Tusk Resort at 9am in the morning in time for a hearty buffet breakfast. Nestled amidst 8 acres of greenery and on the banks of the serene monsoon river Dhela, the Golden Tusk Resort is the perfect world away from the dust and grime of city life and a perfect place to rest, away from the daily grind. It was the perfect weekend getaway and instead of the usual conferences and workshops that most offsites have, the one at JTG had just one agenda- complete and utter relaxation! While a sizeable chunk of the team dived into the swimming pool to cool off, others spent time lolling on hammocks, playing pool volleyball and badminton. The weather was absolutely spectacular and there was much to soak in. And then of course, the selfie marathon always deserves a mention with people making the most of their picturesque surroundings. A sumptuous buffet lunch was followed by lively team building activities like rock climbing and rappelling. While most people hit the snooze button for a while after that (sleeping on the bus wasn’t really an option with all the crazy partying all around), others geared up for the next round of partying with live music and dancing. While a guitarist played live and took requests from us, others huddled around a bonfire and enjoyed the night under a gorgeous star-spangled sky. Day 2- The second day off the off-site started with an action-packed jeep safari at the crack of dawn. Albeit most people had to drag themselves out of bed after a hectic night of partying, spirits were still running high and the team left in 20 jeeps to make their way into Jim Corbett Park to spot wildlife. Enthusiasm on the safari was on a high as pictures were clicked of peacocks, spotted deer, tusked elephants and more. The stunning landscape nestled between the Himalayan foothills, over 600 bird species and animals and reptiles like the tiger, leopard, elephant, otter, gharial, ghoral and yellow throated marten make this national park one of the most sought-after tourist attractions. After returning to the resort, team members refueled with a hearty breakfast buffet and then spent time by the pool, enjoying some leisure time and catching a few winks in time for the upcoming evening bash. The evening saw a group going trekking while others visited the famous Garjiya Devi Temple, an hour’s drive from the resort. A sacred shrine believed to be formed by the mud and clay from a flood years ago, the temple is surrounded by the gleaming waters of the Kosi River and boasts the most idyllic scenery. Day 2 ended with a fun-filled DJ night as the JTG family partied into the wee hours of the morning. It was more than a conventional offsite with spouses of colleagues joining the bandwagon and the directors of JTG matching the revellers step for step. Day 3- After another sumptuous breakfast buffet, the JTG family set off homebound to recover from the offsite hangover (yes! There’s indeed something called too much fun!)

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact      JTG Premier League 2018-2019: The Final Face Off February 26, 2019   Cricket Foosball Fun@Work JPL JTGSportingFever SportsLovers TableTennis  JTG is so much more than just technology. Admittedly, we are the ultimate haven for techies and coders, but we’re also the ‘it’ place for people looking to have a blast at work. Whether it’s our crazy parties, hot’n happening offsites, fun-filled cultural events, our gaming marathons or our sporting events, being a part of the JTG family is sure to keep you on your toes! Our 5-month long sports tournament, JPL (JTG Premier League), is a wellness initiative, sporting event, team engagement activity, and a recreational program- all rolled into one. The 2018-2019 JPL from October to February included table tennis, board games, cricket, and foosball culminating in the grand finale- the go karting and bowling face off between the two best teams. As an organisation truly passionate about sports, we encourage active participation by all team members. With much excitement and speculation surrounding each competition, a total of 90 competitors made it to the final round. The main event was held in Sector 29 at Smaaash in Gurgaon’s sector 29, a popular indoor entertainment centre with bowling and go karting, among many other options. JTG team members were divided into 7 teams with an approximate strength of 12-13 members. To tackle the time crunch (the entire event had to be completed in 2 hours), the go karting and bowling competitions were conducted simultaneously. For go karting, every contender was given 4 minutes to complete the race. The best 2 laps were considered per person. In bowling, while usually 10 sets of throws per person are taken into account, 5 throws were considered as the teams were running out of time. Which wasn’t really a bummer, as it made the game that much more exciting and intense! The 7 teams were Clippers, Maverix, Ultimate Avengers, Dominators, Sole Survivors, Pitch Burners and Silent Thrashers. All the teams gave commendable performances and Ultimate Avengers won the 5th game to bring the final points table in a tie at 1200 with Sole Survivors. But, as per the “gold first rule” of the sports industry, Ultimate Avengers were the ultimate winners of JPL and the ones to take the trophy home. When it comes to JTG sporting events, there’s tons more to enjoy and experience. JTG-ites had a wonderful time chilling out in Smaaash, enjoying live music, and tucking into an assortment of munchies and drinks. JPL is a part of our team wellness initiative and has been successfully getting people to enjoy a more healthy lifestyle while having oodles of fun. Our organizing committee continues to come up with more such innovative ways on how to keep team members up and running, so watch out for the 2019-20 tournament!

       What Solutions Industries Labs Who Our Values Timeline Leadership Team Social Careers Contact     JTG’s CSR Activity- Water Purifier & Cooler Installations for Preventative Health Care March 31, 2019   ABetterWorld CSRActivity JTGSocialResponsibility MakingaDifference SocialWork Water  Our Aim JTG goes the extra mile when it comes to making a positive difference to the society. India as a developing nation is grappling with the scarcity of some of the most essential resources for existence like water and electricity. The unavailability of safe drinking water affects millions of people around the country and JTG aspires to make as much difference as possible to the lives of people deprived of the most basic of amenities, in an effort to reduce waterborne diseases and provide cool water in a country with an oppressively hot climate. Our Actions Over the years, we have taken small but definitive steps in alleviating the sufferings of the marginalised sections of our society by installing water purifiers and coolers in government schools, metro stations, gurdwaras and temples. Keeping our Corporate Social Responsibility in mind, we endeavour to support the lesser privileged sections of our rural and urban communities by working towards enhancing their living standards by providing drinking water and thereby promoting preventative healthcare. Below are some of the locations where Josh Technology Group installed water purifiers and coolers: Paschim Vihar Sikanderpur DLF Phase 1 Metro Station – Govt School Palam Vihar Rajokri – Camp The Driving Need Behind This Initiative Nearly 65 million people in India (roughly 17% of the urban population) lives in slums and 50% of the urban poor families lack safe drinking water. The water crisis is often addressed by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through provision of community-level standpipes or tankers. But even if there’s water, the quality of the water is questionable, leading to a host of sanitation and health problems. Keeping this situation in mind, JTG strives to bridge the gap by installing water purifiers and coolers in locations where the need for safe drinking water is most acutely felt. Rotary helped us in our campaign, JAL HI JEEVAN HAI, to cherry-pick the locations that were most urgently in need of drinking water- Location address: Prachin Hanuman Mandir, Rajokri Pahari, New Delhi Installed : Jan 2018 People served: 5000 Approx ———————————————– Location address: Prachin Ram Mandir, Chakkarpur, Gurgaon Installed : March 2017 People served: 3000 Approx ———————————————- Location address: Rajkiya Prathmik Shala, Gurugram Installed : Jan 2019 People served: 1000 Approx ———————————————– Project : JAL HI JEEVAN HAI Location address: Shiv Mandir, Carterpuri, Palam Vihar, Gurugram Installed : June 2016 People served: 3500 Approx ———————————————– Location address: Hanuman Mandir, Pachim Vihar Village, New Delhi Installed : Oct 2018 People served: 7000 Approx ———————————————– Location address: Hargobind Gurudwara, Andrewsganj, New Delhi Installed : May 2017 People served: 3800 Approx Rotary- Our heartfelt gratitude to Rotary, a name that needs little introduction in the field of humanitarian service worldwide. The organisation started operating in 1910 and has since promoted goodwill and peace around the world through social service and countless projects aimed at addressing critical issues and making lives better. From championing peace, fighting illiteracy and poverty to promoting  clean water, sanitation and fighting diseases, Rotarians are progressing steadily to create ever-lasting impact through their actions and are currently more than 1.2 million members strong with more than 35000 clubs worldwide.
